# Coding & Cocktails Drink Order App

## Overview

This application allows us to practice multiple different skills.  We've utilized this app to practice collaboration using git and GitHub, added interactivity with jQuery and we also practice some programming fundamentals with JavaScript here as well. 

## Version Control Collaboration

First we started learning version control using git & GitHub.  In this session we practiced updating the page and working on fixing an assigned issue as as a developer would do on a collaborative team. You can also refer back to examples from [the presentation](http://kansascitywomenintechnology.github.io/GitBasics/#/).

### Relevant Branches
master: The starting point and main branch  
issue-##: Branch practice to work on development for the assigned issue.

## jQuery Interactivity

We use jQuery (a JavaScript library) to add functionality to our order form on our Drink order application, and implement plugins to make our site look nice. You can also refer back to examples from [the presentation](http://kansascitywomenintechnology.github.io/jQueryIntro/#/).

## JavaScript Programming Fundamentals

This continues with adding interactivity to the site using JavaScript.  We will practice several key concepts of programming with this worksheet.  You can also refere back to examples from [the presentation](http://kansascitywomenintechnology.github.io/JSProgrammingFundamentals/#/).
